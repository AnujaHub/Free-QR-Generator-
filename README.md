# Free-QR-Generator-

This tools helps you generate free QRs and also download them . 
All the user needs to do is enetr the link/content to be redirected to / viewed once the Qr is scanned . 

p.s 
this is an impromptu project :P
my brother is getting married in Feb we had put a QR code for the Google map link to the wedding venue on the wedding card but after a couple scans ads started to appear so instaed of paying for a service i thought why not research a bit and make my own free QR generator :)
